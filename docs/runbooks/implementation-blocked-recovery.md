# Recover an implementation-blocked issue

## When to use

Use this runbook when an issue has `state:implementation-blocked`. The
label means that an implementation run completed without a commit and needs a
human decision. It does not mean that the issue should be skipped.

The pipeline keeps the existing `state:plan-go` label. It does not start
another implementation run or request a new plan while the implementation
block remains.

## Check the block

Read the current issue labels and the feedback comment:

    gh issue view <N> --json labels,comments

Review the implementation-agent summary. Treat it as bounded context. Do not
use raw logs, secrets, or unbounded terminal output as recovery input.

## Choose one action

Make one deliberate human state transition. Remove the implementation latch
only after you choose the action.

- Continue implementation under the approved plan. Remove
  `state:implementation-blocked`, keep `state:plan-go`, and run
  `hephaestus-implement-issues --issues <N>`.
- Clarify the requirements. Update the issue, then remove the latch and run
  the implementation command after the requirements are clear.
- Mark the issue as already satisfied. Remove the implementation latch and
  apply `state:skip` when the issue is complete.
- Explicitly skip the issue. Apply `state:skip` and remove the
  implementation latch.
- Request a new plan revision. Do this only when the approved plan is
  invalid. Remove the implementation latch, then run
  `hephaestus-plan-issues --issues <N> --force` as an explicit human
  action.

For the first two actions, remove the latch with:

    gh issue edit <N> --remove-label state:implementation-blocked

To record an explicit skip in one transition, use:

    gh issue edit <N> --add-label state:skip --remove-label state:implementation-blocked

After the transition, confirm the labels again. The next pipeline pass must
show the selected state. A comment alone does not resume automation.

## Safety rules

- Keep `state:plan-go` when the approved plan remains valid.
- Do not remove or replace `state:implementation-blocked` without a
  human decision.
- Use `--force` only for the explicit plan-revision action. The
  implementation stage never invokes it automatically for a no-commit run.
- If a label or comment read is unclear, stop and repair the GitHub state
  before starting another agent.
