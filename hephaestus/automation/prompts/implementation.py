Implement GitHub issue #{issue_number}.

{untrusted_notice}

**Working Directory:** {worktree_path}
**Branch:** {branch_name}

**Issue Title (untrusted):** {issue_title}

**Issue Description (untrusted):**
{issue_body_block}

---

**Context you have (TASK / PLAN / REVIEW model):**
- The TASK — the issue title + description above (source of truth for
  requirements; written externally, never edited by you).
- The PLAN — the single `# Implementation Plan` comment on the issue, plus
  its `## 🔍 Plan Review` (the approved plan and the review that approved it).
  Read both before writing code; implement the approved plan.
- On later loop iterations only: the inline PR-review threads raised against
  your diff, which you must address in this same session before re-review.
  Those threads live on the PR, not the issue.

**Implementation Context:**
- Run `gh issue view {issue_number} --comments` to read the full plan and its
  plan review, plus any comments
- Follow the project's Python conventions and type hint all function signatures

{terse_output_directive}

**Critical Requirements:**
1. Read the issue description and any existing plan carefully
2. Follow existing code patterns in hephaestus/
3. Write tests in tests/ using pytest
4. Run tests with: pixi run python -m pytest tests/ -v
5. Ensure all tests pass before finishing
6. Follow the code quality guidelines in CLAUDE.md

**Testing:**
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Use pytest fixtures and parametrize where appropriate

**Code Quality:**
- Type hint all function signatures
- Write docstrings for public APIs
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep solutions simple and focused

**File Handling:**
- DO NOT create backup files (.orig, .bak, .swp, etc.)
- DO NOT leave temporary or editor backup files
- Clean up any backup files before finishing
- Only stage actual implementation files

**Git Boundary (MANDATORY — non-negotiable policy):**
Your job is to edit files and run the relevant local tests. The
ProjectHephaestus orchestrator owns all git and GitHub mutation after this
agent turn returns.

- DO NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, or any
  other command that writes to GitHub.
- Leave the final implementation changes in the working tree.
- When you finish, summarize what changed and what tests you ran.

After you return, the orchestrator will:
1. Create a cryptographically signed and DCO-signed commit with `git commit -S -s`.
2. Push the branch to origin.
3. Create or reuse the pull request for this branch.
4. Ensure the PR body contains the exact policy line `Closes #{issue_number}`.
5. Keep auto-merge disabled until the implementation-review loop marks the PR
   with `state:implementation-go`.

A PR that fails any of these policy checks will be blocked by the required CI
gate. This policy applies to every PR — no exceptions.

approved plan the diff is meant to implement), and the implementer's diff
