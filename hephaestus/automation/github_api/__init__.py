"""GitHub API utilities using gh CLI.

This package preserves the import and patch surface of the former
``hephaestus.automation.github_api`` module while splitting responsibilities
across focused submodules. Submodules resolve patchable collaborators through
this package namespace at call time so existing ``mock.patch("...github_api.X")``
seams keep working.
