# AGENTS.md

This file is the single authoritative agent contract for Hephaestus. It is
self-contained: it holds the project overview, development rules (commit policy,
branch naming, version model), the skill catalog, and the AI-agent topology map
used by Hephaestus and the wider HomericIntelligence ecosystem. For enabled skill
plugins see [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json).

## Project Overview

Hephaestus is the shared utilities and tooling repository of the
HomericIntelligence ecosystem. Named after Hephaestus, the Greek god of
craftsmanship, forging, and ingenious invention, this project provides the
foundational scripts, helpers, and infrastructure that support development across
all other repositories.

**Purpose**: Centralize and maintain Python utilities, helper functions, and
common abstractions used throughout the HomericIntelligence suite.

**Role in Ecosystem**:

- Odyssey → Training and capability development
- Keystone → Automated task DAG execution
- Scylla → Testing, measurement, and optimization
- Mnemosyne → Knowledge, skills, and memory preservation
- Hermes → Agent communication and message routing
- Argus → Observability, monitoring, and alerting
- Proteus → Dynamic configuration and environment adaptation
- Myrmidons → Agent swarm coordination and task distribution
- AchaeanFleet → Multi-agent fleet orchestration
- **Hephaestus → Shared utilities, tooling, and foundational components**

## ASD-STE100 writing standard

Hephaestus MUST use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English for all English
technical prose that it owns and creates or revises. Hephaestus adopts Issue 9,
dated January 15, 2025. Use this issue until the project explicitly adopts a
later issue.

This rule applies to Hephaestus-owned skill text, agent directions, packaged
prompts, documentation, code comments, docstrings, user-interface text, and
issue or pull-request text. It also applies to new or revised text that an agent
creates when Hephaestus supplies an external skill. Do not change third-party
skill source text or versioned external contract fixtures.

The wording of the project principles is the only prose exception. This
exception applies only to sections or prompt blocks that explicitly declare
project principles, including specialized principle lists. Do not rewrite this
text to meet the writing standard. References to, explanations of, and
applications of a principle MUST follow the standard.

Follow the complete [Hephaestus ASD-STE100 policy](docs/asd-ste100.md). Use the
[official ASD-STE100 website](https://www.asd-ste100.org/) and
[request a free official copy](https://www.asd-ste100.org/STE_downloads.html)
when you need the standard. Do not copy its rules, dictionary, PDF, or logo
into this repository. This project policy does not state or imply that ASD or
STEMG approves, certifies, or endorses Hephaestus.

```

Agent skills are supplied by the Athena plugins enabled in
`.claude/settings.json`; plugin skill names use kebab-case
(`code-review`, `git-worktrees`). All Python packages use
lowercase_snake_case.

## Library vs product layer

`hephaestus/automation/` is an opt-in product layer co-located with the utility
library. It is gated behind the
`HomericIntelligence-Hephaestus[automation]` optional extra. The base
`import hephaestus` surface MUST NOT pull `curses`, `fcntl`, `pydantic`,
or any `hephaestus.automation.*` module. Enforced by
`tests/unit/validation/test_import_surface.py` (subprocess) and
`tests/unit/validation/test_automation_boundary.py` (static grep).

Library subpackages of `hephaestus` may not import from
`hephaestus.automation`. The dependency arrow points only one way:
automation → library. See `docs/adr/0001-automation-library-boundary.md`.

Significant architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/`; see
`docs/adr/README.md` for the enumerable index.

When a plan or review proposes a new ADR, refer to it as the "next available
ADR number." Do not reserve or hardcode a new ADR number in a plan, review,
prompt, or reusable direction. Immediately before the implementation creates
the ADR file, read the current `docs/adr/README.md` index and allocate the next
unused number. If concurrent work takes that number, read the index again and
use the new next unused number. References to existing ADRs must use their
exact assigned numbers.

### Coverage omit-list invariant

Whole `hephaestus/automation/*.py` modules remain in coverage measurement.
Hermetic unit tests inject agent, GitHub, Git, subprocess, clock, and terminal
seams, while `coverage.toml` applies explicit per-module line-coverage floors
to orchestration facades.

`tests/unit/validation/test_omit_allowlist.py` requires the Coverage.py omit
list to equal the two generic exclusions for tests and package
`__init__.py` files. The retained migration sources and the shared
`pipeline_cli.py` must each meet a 70% line-coverage floor. These sources are
`implementer.py`, `planner.py`, `loop_runner.py`, `loop_repo_manager.py`,
`address_review_core.py`, and `pipeline_cli.py`. Remove a module floor only when
its source is deleted. Keep all other module floors. A future omission for
external execution requires a documented boundary and an explicit change to
this allowlist contract. Imports and test names do not prove coverage.

## Python Development Guidelines

### Language Preference

**Python 3.13** is the implementation language for all Hephaestus code:

- Shared utility scripts and helpers
- Configuration management tools
- Logging and monitoring utilities
- Cross-project abstraction layers
- Automation and maintenance scripts

### Key Principles

1. **Modularity**: Develop independent modules with well-defined interfaces
2. **Reusability**: Design components for use across multiple projects
3. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
4. **Reliability**: Write robust, well-tested code with clear error handling
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

### Python Standards

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Module description with purpose, usage, and examples.

Usage:
    python scripts/script_name.py [options]
"""

# Standard library imports first
import sys
import os
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

# Third-party imports next
# import requests
# import numpy as np

# Local imports last
# from hephaestus.utils.helpers import helper_function


def function_name(param: str, optional_param: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    """Clear docstring with purpose, parameters, and return value.

    Args:
        param: Description of parameter
        optional_param: Description of optional parameter

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        SpecificException: When something goes wrong
    """
    pass
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.13
- Type hints required for all functions
- Clear docstrings for public functions and classes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit tests) — 85%+ test coverage enforced by the CI gate (`fail_under = 85`); target 90%
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Key Development Principles

1. **KISS** - *Keep It Simple, Stupid* → Don't add complexity when a simpler solution works
2. **YAGNI** - *You Ain't Gonna Need It* → Don't add things until they are required
3. **DRY** - *Don't Repeat Yourself* → Don't duplicate functionality, data structures, or algorithms
4. **SOLID** Principles:
   - Single Responsibility: Each module/class should have one reason to change
   - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Interface Segregation: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
5. **Modularity** - Develop independent modules through well-defined interfaces
6. **POLA** - *Principle of Least Astonishment* - Create intuitive and predictable interfaces

## Security Configuration Guidelines

### Secrets Management

- **Never hardcode secrets** in source code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Reference secret management systems when appropriate
- Document secret requirements in README, not code

### Input Validation

All utility functions accepting external input must:

1. Validate input types and ranges
2. Sanitize potentially malicious content
3. Handle encoding/decoding safely
4. Log suspicious inputs appropriately

### Secure Coding Practices

- Always use parameterized queries for database interactions
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow principle of least privilege for file system access
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs

## Documentation Rules

### Code Documentation

- **Inline Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Function Docstrings**: Follow Google Python Style Guide
- **Class Docstrings**: Describe purpose, attributes, and usage
- **Module Docstrings**: Explain module purpose and key components

### Technical Documentation

- Maintain README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Document API endpoints in OpenAPI format when applicable
- Reference external documentation rather than duplicating
- Follow the [ASD-STE100 writing standard](docs/asd-ste100.md)

**No CHANGELOG.md.** Do not create, edit, or file issues against `CHANGELOG.md`. Release notes are generated from commits at release time via `gh release create --generate-notes`. Audit reports MUST NOT flag missing/stale changelog entries.

## Claude Code Optimization

### When to Use Extended Thinking

Use Extended Thinking for:

- Designing new utility abstractions
- Analyzing complex cross-cutting concerns
- Planning refactoring of shared components
- Understanding dependency relationships
- Evaluating tradeoffs in utility design

Skip Extended Thinking for:

- Simple utility function implementation
- Straightforward bug fixes
- Boilerplate code generation
- Well-defined refactorings

### Automatic Skill Selection

Before a substantive task, select the applicable skills from the installed
skill catalog. Always use that catalog as the starting point. You may also use
`athena:skill-advisor` when it is available and useful. The advisor is optional;
its absence or failure does not block skill selection or the task.
Keep all applicable task, skill, and repository requirements.

For a subagent task, use the installed catalog for the assigned scope and
follow the task prompt.

### Delegated Verification

The main agent must not run local verification commands. It must use one or
more test-only subagents for verification and wait for their reports. One
subagent can run multiple related verification commands. The main agent can
use more subagents when separate verification work benefits from parallel
execution. Use `gpt-5.6-luna`
with `xhigh` reasoning by default for these subagents.

Verification includes unit, integration, and shell tests; lint checks;
formatter checks; and type checks. Give the subagent the exact commands that
are necessary. The subagent must only run verification commands. It must not
edit repository files. Use a check-only command when a tool can change files.
Do not run `pre-commit run` separately for delegated verification. Let Git run
its installed, mutating hooks during commit and push.

For a pass, the subagent report must list each command and confirm that it
passed. For a failure, the report must include the command, its exit status,
concise failure evidence, the affected tests or checks, and a first-stage
root-cause analysis. The subagent must not fix a failure unless it receives a
separate direction to do so.

### Skill Catalog

Invoke an Athena skill with `Skill(skill: "athena:<name>", args: "<argument>")`, or
`/athena:<name> <argument>` interactively. The **Arguments** column mirrors the
Athena plugin's `argument-hint` frontmatter; `—` means the skill takes no
argument. `.claude/settings.json` is the
repository-local source of truth for which skill plugins are enabled.

| Skill | Arguments | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `athena:skill-advisor` | `<task description>` | Optional aid after consulting the installed skill catalog |
| `athena:advise` | `<task description>` | Before starting work — search Mnemosyne for prior learnings |

### Agent Skills vs Sub-Agents Decision Tree

```text
Is the task well-defined with predictable steps?
├─ YES → Use an Agent Skill (see catalog above)
│   ├─ Is it a new feature? → brainstorm → test-driven-development
│   ├─ Is it a bug? → systematic-debugging → test-driven-development
│   ├─ Is it ready to ship? → verification → finish-branch
│   ├─ Is it a CI/CD pipeline setup? → github-actions-python-cicd
│   ├─ Is it a repo audit? → repo-analyze (or its quick/strict/full variants)
│   └─ Is it a PR review? → `$athena:pr-review`
│
└─ NO → Use a Sub-Agent
    ├─ Does it require exploration/discovery? → Use sub-agent
    ├─ Does it need adaptive decision-making? → Use sub-agent
    ├─ Is the workflow dynamic/context-dependent? → Use myrmidon-swarm
    └─ Does it need extended thinking? → Use sub-agent
```

### Output Style Guidelines

#### Code References

**DO**: Use repo-relative file paths with line numbers:

```markdown
Updated hephaestus/utils/helpers.py:45-52
```

#### GitHub Issue Integration

**DO**: Post implementation notes as GitHub issue comments:

```bash
gh issue comment <number> --body "Completed implementation of new logging utility"
```

## Working with GitHub

### Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through a pull request.

Hephaestus uses trunk-based development: create one short-lived feature
branch per issue, open a pull request, squash-merge it back to `main`, and cut
releases from signed `vX.Y.Z` tags; there are no release branches.

#### PR policy

The required CI gate `pr-policy` and the PR reviewer enforce:

1. The PR body MUST contain the literal line `Closes #<issue-number>` (capital
   `C`, no colon, on its own line). `Fixes`, `Resolves`, `closes`, and
   `Closes:` are NOT accepted.
2. Commit subjects MUST follow Conventional Commits.
3. Every commit MUST carry a DCO `Signed-off-by` trailer.

The active `homeric-main-baseline` ruleset requires cryptographically signed
commits (`required_signatures`).

PR titles MUST follow `type(scope)!: description` because the title becomes the
squash-merge subject on `main`. Scope and `!` are optional; Check 2 also
validates every branch commit subject. See the [Definition of Done](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md)
for accepted forms and the grandfathered pre-#2157 history policy.

`pr-policy` blocks PRs that fail those checks. The queue runs
`$athena:pr-review` in its normal default profile when available. Its prose,
grades, and decision-shaped output are audit evidence, not authorization.
`pr_review` applies `state:implementation-go` only after its structural audit
and fresh live GitHub facts confirm the reviewed open, unarmed head, complete
thread state, and an exclusive label transition by readback. That GitHub label
is automated implementation eligibility. Before each server merge request,
`merge_wait` requires the current-process reviewed-head proof or a verified
retained rebase proof. It requires complete passing status evidence for the
merge head. A retained proof keeps the original review identity and binds a
separate resulting commit after host verification. It reads the effective
classic and ruleset policy. A required merge queue uses exact-head GraphQL
admission. A direct SHA-conditional merge is available only when one policy
source applies strict-update protection that the current actor cannot bypass.
No queue stage mutates native auto-merge.
Normal review may collect CI/CD evidence as context, but `merge_wait` uses
complete passing required status evidence for the exact reviewed head as a
separate merge gate. CI workflows and external artifacts never independently
grant the loop-owned label authority. Branch protection and required CI/CD
checks are the merge contract. This single-maintainer repository intentionally keeps the
GitHub required-approving-review count at zero. Generic or unmarked human
approvals are not branch-protection merge gates, and a second user or marked
`APPROVED` review is not a queue merge requirement.

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b <issue-number>-description

# 2. Make changes and commit (cryptographically signed and DCO-signed)
git add <files>
git commit -s -S -m "type(scope): description"
git log --show-signature -1   # verify the signature took

# 3. Push feature branch
git push -u origin <branch-name>

# 4. Create pull request
gh pr create \
  --title "[Type] Brief description" \
  --body "$(printf 'Summary of change.\n\nCloses #<issue-number>\n')"

# 5. Do not use --admin or bypass branch protection. Queue stages do not mutate
#    native auto-merge. merge_wait uses the server route that policy requires.
```

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits:

```text
feat(utils): Add new configuration helper
fix(logging): Correct timestamp formatting
docs(readme): Update installation instructions
refactor(io): Simplify file handling logic
```

### Testing Strategy

All utility functions must include comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Cross-platform**: Ensure compatibility across supported environments

Before an agent creates a pull request, it MUST run each new or changed test.
The command MUST collect those tests and report success.

For a manual contribution, finish the implementation and rebase the branch on
the current `origin/main`. If the rebase or conflict resolution changes a file,
run each affected test again. Run the full locked local suite after this final
rebase and before the push. Test evidence must apply to the final pushed head.
Run the suite again only if the branch head changes. Keep environment setup
checks separate from change verification. Required CI/CD supplies separate
head-bound evidence.

The automation loop uses the rebase policy in ADR-0047. It prepares the branch
before implementation and does not do a routine final rebase. An operator can
request the explicit `--rebase` path.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/utils/test_general_utils.py -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit --cov=hephaestus --cov-report=html

# Run the full locked local suite after the last rebase
uv run --locked pytest tests/unit tests/integration --override-ini="addopts=" -v --strict-markers -m "not performance and not contract and not artifact and not codex_release_artifact"
```

## Environment Setup

This project uses [uv](https://uv.sh) for environment management. The
one-command bootstrap (deps + editable install + pre-commit hooks) is
`just bootstrap`:

```bash
# Install deps, the editable hephaestus package, and pre-commit hooks
just bootstrap
```

`just bootstrap` wraps the two commands below. Run them manually if you do
not have [`just`](https://just.systems/) installed:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and create the environment
uv sync

# 2. Install the pre-commit hooks (uv-managed binary)
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Common Commands

### Development Workflows

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/unit

# Run linter
uv run ruff check hephaestus/ tests/

# Check formatter
uv run ruff format --check hephaestus/ tests/

# Run type checking
uv run mypy hephaestus/ scripts/ tests/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically check code quality. They MUST NOT run pytest.
Run the required full locked local suite separately after the last rebase.
Required CI/CD supplies separate test evidence for the pushed head.

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# NEVER skip hooks with --no-verify
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Check that `uv sync` has been run
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Update `pyproject.toml` and run `uv sync`
3. **Test Failures**: Run tests with verbose output for details
4. **Formatting Issues**: Run `uv run ruff format hephaestus/ tests/`

### Getting Help

1. Check existing GitHub issues and discussions
2. Review documentation in docs/ directory
3. Post implementation questions as issue comments

## Version Management

This project uses **hatch-vcs dynamic versioning** — the package version is derived
from git tags, not stored in any file.

- **Single source of truth**: the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag. `pyproject.toml` declares
  `dynamic = ["version"]` with `[tool.hatch.version]` `source = "vcs"`; there is **no**
  static `[project].version` field.
- **`hephaestus/_version.py`** is generated at build time by the hatch-vcs build hook
  (`[tool.hatch.build.hooks.vcs]`, `version-file = "hephaestus/_version.py"`) and is not
  committed. At runtime, `hephaestus/__init__.py` reads `__version__` from installed
  package metadata via `importlib.metadata`.
- **`pyproject.toml`** intentionally has no version field — do not add one.
- The `check-version-single-source` pre-commit hook enforces this invariant: it fails if
  a static `[project].version` is reintroduced, if `dynamic = ["version"]` or
  `[tool.hatch.version]` `source = "vcs"` is missing.
- To cut a release you do **not** edit any version field — a signed `vX.Y.Z` git tag drives
  it. See `docs/RELEASING.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the workflow.

Make sure all temporary files are in the build/ directory.

## AI-agent topology

The remainder of this document is a single-page map of the AI-agent topology and
conventions used by Hephaestus and the wider HomericIntelligence ecosystem.
The queue topology below is implemented as six main-lane queues and two
auxiliary queues.

## Agents the codebase orchestrates

The default `hephaestus-automation-loop` path is the queue-based in-process
pipeline in `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.coordinator`. The coordinator owns
eight bounded stage queues. A main worker pool runs ordinary work. A separate
host-only pool runs learning and terminal cleanup. Each agent job runs
**Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Pi** (admission-gated), or **OpenCode**, chosen via the
optional `--agent` CLI flag or auto-detected with a Claude preference when
omitted (see `hephaestus.agents.runtime.add_agent_argument`).
Pi is never auto-selected.

**Loop-owned approval policy:** `pr_review` invokes `$athena:pr-review` with
its normal default behavior when available, otherwise uses its inline-review
fallback. It posts inline findings and, after a clean Go-label proof, one
ordinary public PR comment containing an informational audit summary. Only a
structural audit plus fresh live GitHub head, thread, and exclusive-label facts
may write `state:implementation-go`; review prose, grades, and decision-shaped
output do not authorize it. Normal review may collect CI/CD evidence as
context, but the loop does not change CI/CD and no workflow, status, artifact,
or lease independently authorizes it. `merge_wait` additionally requires
complete passing required status evidence for the merge head before the
server merge request. A host-verified rebase can supply a separate merge head
while the original reviewed head remains unchanged. It uses exact-head queue
admission when the effective ruleset requires a merge queue. Otherwise, direct merge requires strict-update
protection from a source that the current actor cannot bypass. No queue stage
mutates native auto-merge.

A reviewer can report a required scope expansion in its structural audit. The
host creates one deterministic child issue and keeps the source PR in the
exclusive implementation-NO-GO state. The host reconciles that child before a
later review checkout. An open child parks the source PR without review-budget
cost. A closed child without merged implementation needs operator action. A
merged child that is absent from the source branch requires a manual rebase.
The source PR then needs a fresh broad review. No agent receives the expansion as source-branch implementation
work. In a mixed audit, only a validated scope retraction can go to the writer
before the source PR parks.

| Queue stage | Module | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| repo | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.repo` | Clone/discover, classify issues/PRs, and seed entry queues |
| planning | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.planning` | Advise and produce an implementation plan |
| plan_review | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.plan_review` | Strict plan review, amendment, and plan labels |
| implementation | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.implementation` | PR-writer worktree, rebase, implementation, tests, commit/push, and PR creation |
| pr_review | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.pr_review` | Scope-dependency reconciliation, detached read-only review, validation, one batched inline review, and implementation labels |
| merge_wait | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.merge_wait` | Conditionally merges the exact reviewed head and emits post-merge learning intent |
| learning | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.learning` | Claims durable intents and submits host-owned learning work |
| finished | `hephaestus.automation.pipeline.stages.finished` | Terminal ledger and auxiliary worktree cleanup/preservation |

`--learning-workers` and `--learning-queue-capacity` bound the auxiliary lane
independently. Both default to `1`. `--no-learn` prevents new learning work and
execution of learning intents.

Four console scripts use one parser and configuration builder in
`hephaestus.automation.pipeline_cli`:

| Console script | Entry module | Main stage scope |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| `hephaestus-automation-loop` | `hephaestus.automation.loop_runner` | All six main stages |
| `hephaestus-plan-issues` | `hephaestus.automation.planner` | `planning → plan_review` |
| `hephaestus-implement-issues` | `hephaestus.automation.implementer` | `implementation → pr_review → merge_wait` |
| `hephaestus-review-prs` | `hephaestus.automation.pr_reviewer` | `pr_review` |

Learning and finished are implicit auxiliary stages for every scope. The full
command accepts `--stages` with contiguous main stage names in queue order.
Use `--merge-attempts` and `--max-workers`. Removed commands and option aliases
have no compatibility path.

The coordinator owns admission, routes, timers, permits, and completion.
Workers receive frozen requests and return one result for coordinator routing.
The accepted work item retains its repository-qualified file reservation
through implementation, review, and merge. Source jobs use an explicit
workspace binding. The worker checks source ownership under the workspace
lease before execution. One deadline covers lock waits, checks, and execution.

Current journals preserve plan pointers, publication repair, learning claims,
issue-wave checkpoints, source ownership, and reply recovery. A recovered GO
publication receipt cannot grant current-process review proof. On restart,
review must obtain fresh source and review evidence before merge. Reply
handoffs support armed format 2 and remediation format 3.

Stop old coordinators before cutover or rollback. Preserve uncertain effects,
local commits, worktrees, and current journals. Do not run old and new owners
against the same state directory. See
[ADR-0050](docs/adr/0050-queue-owned-automation-cutover.md).

## Agent runtime

`hephaestus.agents.runtime` is the thin layer that abstracts over Claude Code,
Codex, the currently fail-closed Pi provider boundary, and OpenCode. It provides:

- `add_agent_argument(parser)` — adds a uniform `--agent` flag to any CLI.
- `is_codex(agent_str)` / `is_pi(agent_str)` / `is_opencode(agent_str)` —
  provider-adapter branches kept inside the shared runtime.
- `run_codex_*` and `run_agent_*` text/session/resume helpers invoke direct
  providers through the neutral boundary. Public `run_pi_*` execution helpers
  also reject unadmitted automation; only `run_pi_smoke_session` is the fixed
  tool-free, non-interactive operator smoke seam. Normal Pi automation requires
  a reviewed external OS-isolation adapter. A fresh process loads only the
  explicitly selected `HEPH_PI_ISOLATION_ADAPTER` factory from the
  `hephaestus.pi_isolation_adapters` entry-point group; the base package ships
  no adapter and never auto-selects one.
  `hephaestus-install-pi-plugins` installs and preflights the catalog-pinned Pi
  CLI/package set, but passing preflight does not bypass external isolation,
  lifecycle, or role-scope admission gates. The smoke seam is not admission
  evidence. See ADR-0019, ADR-0020, ADR-0023, and ADR-0029.
- Claude is normally invoked via `hephaestus.automation.claude_invoke.invoke_claude_with_session`;
  the library-only fleet-sync conflict fallback uses `claude_code_sdk` with the scoped call-site
  controls below.

Athena `advise` and `learn` are host-owned operations, not agent-runtime
operations. `AthenaSkillJob` routes them only to the Mnemosyne host executor.
They do not invoke or validate Claude, Codex, Pi, or another harness. Provider
package, policy, and isolation checks apply only when a job executes through
that provider. Learning jobs carry a semantic intent; the host rebinds its
verified merged-PR evidence and reviewed candidate, prepares one bounded
validated skill change, then sends the closed request to the signed PR-delivery
service. Plan approval does not create learning work. See ADR-0025, ADR-0032,
and [learning evidence](docs/learning-evidence.md).

`hephaestus.automation.agent_config` supplies model, session, and timeout
defaults. The common parser exposes role timeout options, `--poll-max-wait`,
and `--git-message-timeout`. Host-owned advice and learning do not use agent
provider timeout options.

The automation loop selects tools and model strings independently. Use
`--planner-agent`, `--implementer-agent`, and `--reviewer-agent` to override
`--agent` for each role. Each role model overrides `--model`; a tool override
does not clear the global model. Omitted models use the selected tool default.
There is no model catalog or alias translation. Implementation helpers inherit
the implementation tool and model. Supply `--fallback-model` explicitly to
select a fallback. See ADR-0044.

The automation loop model options accept `MODEL[:EFFORT]`. The final nonempty
colon segment is a free-form effort. The runtime maps it to Codex
`model_reasoning_effort`, OpenCode `--variant`, or Pi `--thinking`. The value
`default` selects the applicable provider default. Claude uses the base model
without an effort selector. Codex retries one exact pre-work
unsupported-effort rejection without an explicit effort. OpenCode and Pi own
their native fallback behavior. OpenCode v1 applies only variants that its
resolved model configuration defines. It uses the base model options for an
unknown variant.

## Design Philosophy

The agent topology above is not accidental — it follows a small set of design
principles inherited from **ProjectOdyssey**, where the queue-based agent loop
and plan/review quality gates were first incubated before being generalized into
Hephaestus's shared tooling. Those principles, applied to agent design, are:

- **Simplicity first (KISS / YAGNI).** Each queue stage owns one responsibility
  and one reason to change; we do not add stages, providers, or abstractions
  until a concrete workflow needs them. The deferred `AgentProtocol` and
  resilience wiring (issues #468, #469) are intentionally *not* built yet.
- **One-way dependencies (DRY / boundaries).** The dependency arrow points only
  automation → library (see [Library vs product layer](#library-vs-product-layer)).
  Prompt construction lives in exactly one module (`hephaestus.automation.prompts`)
  so untrusted-content fencing is defined once, not per call site.
- **Substitutable providers (SOLID).** `hephaestus.agents.runtime` abstracts over
  Claude Code and Codex behind a uniform `--agent` flag so either provider is
  substitutable at a call site without changing orchestration logic.
- **Least privilege, least astonishment (POLA).** Every agent call site declares
  an explicit `--allowedTools` scope (see the permission-policy table below),
  runs in a scoped worktree, and defers irreversible actions to explicit
  repository policy gates.
- **CI/CD-gated merges.** Merge eligibility is enforced by branch protection
  and required CI/CD checks, especially the `pr-policy` gate. Review prose and
  optional review signals are audit evidence, not merge authorization.

For the full, non-agent-specific statement of these principles see
[Key Development Principles](#key-development-principles).

## Claude non-interactive permission policy

Claude invocations that pass `permission_mode="dontAsk"` are non-interactive
automation calls. They do not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and
`hephaestus.automation.claude_invoke.invoke_claude_with_session` still forwards
the explicit `--allowedTools` scope. There is no OS-level seccomp, namespace, or chroot sandbox on this Claude path. The compensating controls are per-call tool
allowlists, cwd/worktree scoping, subprocess timeouts, prompt fencing for
untrusted GitHub content, secure logs, and GitHub branch protection plus the
required CI/CD checks.

`--allowedTools` supplies tool approvals. It does not restrict tool availability
by itself. The queue worker uses the explicit job scope when one is supplied.
Without an explicit scope, a read-only job uses `Read,Glob,Grep`. Other jobs use
the scope for their agent role. The worker forwards this scope and `dontAsk`
through the shared Claude invocation path.

| Call site | Tools | Scope / controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipeline/worker_pool.py:WorkerPool._invoke_agent` | Job scope, role scope, or `Read,Glob,Grep` | The worker applies the selected tool scope, `dontAsk`, the source lease, and the operation deadline. |
| `pipeline/stages/pr_review_jobs.py:PrReviewJobs._submit_review_job` | `Read,Glob,Grep,Bash,Skill,Agent,WebFetch` | The queue submits a read-only review job for the exact source head. The host owns review publication, labels, and merge admission. |
| `pipeline/stages/implementation.py` | `Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep,Bash` | The implementation job uses an isolated writer workspace. Host operations own Git publication and its policy checks. |
| `github/fleet_sync/conflict_resolver.py:_run_conflict_agent` | `none` | The conflict planner returns JSON edits from fenced input. The host validates paths and owns Git continuation, signing, and push. |

Fleet-sync `--dry-run` is a preview contract: GitHub reads and writes, Git subprocesses, pushes,
merges, and agent calls are suppressed or logged. The CLI may still allocate an ephemeral
temporary directory and pass Git actions through the dry-run logger so operators can see what
would run; no clone, worktree, rebase, or other Git mutation is executed.

## Prompt safety

`hephaestus.automation.prompts` builds every prompt the agents see. The module's
contract — enforced by the test suite — is that **all untrusted GitHub content**
(issue bodies, PR diffs, reviewer comments, plan text) is wrapped with
`_fence_untrusted()` using random nonces and accompanied by `_UNTRUSTED_NOTICE`.
This prevents a hostile issue body from forging a verdict line or injecting
instructions that bypass the PR review loop. See the tests in
`tests/unit/automation/test_prompts.py` for the regression coverage.

## Agent safety checkpoints

Several plugin-provided skills define workflow safety checks for agent actions.
These are workflow safety controls, not GitHub required approvals or merge
gates:

- `/athena:myrmidon-swarm`: If host policy or task scope requires approval,
  present the plan and ask for approval. Start safe work that is in scope only
  after you obtain all required approvals.
- `athena:skill-advisor` — optional aid when available and useful. Always
  consult the installed skill catalog first. Advisor failure does not block
  work. Routing does not grant permission for other actions.
- `/athena:finish-branch` and `/athena:code-review` — explicit confirm
  steps before tagging or force-pushing.

Every PR opened by the automation pipeline goes through GitHub's normal branch
protection and the `pr-policy` required-check gate
(see [PR policy](#pr-policy)); required CI/CD checks enforce the merge contract,
and the GitHub required-approving-review count remains intentionally zero for
this single-maintainer repository.

## Skill catalog (agent highlights)

The Athena plugins enabled in `.claude/settings.json` provide 23 reusable skills
the agents can invoke. See the [Skill Catalog](#skill-catalog) table above for
the full listing. Highlights:

- **Workflow**: `skill-advisor`, `advise`, `brainstorm`, `test-driven-development`,
  `systematic-debugging`, `verification`, `finish-branch`, `code-review`.
- **Repo audits**: `repo-analyze` and its `-quick`, `-strict`, `-full`, and
  `*-full` variants.
- **Worktrees**: `git-worktrees`, `worktree-cleanup`, `tidy`.
- **Orchestration**: `myrmidon-swarm` for hierarchical multi-agent fan-out.
- **Knowledge capture**: `learn` (writes back to the Mnemosyne marketplace).

## Configuration / boundaries

- Skill hooks, frontmatter, and per-skill `allowed-tools` are owned by the
  installed Athena plugins; `.claude/settings.json` is the repository-local
  source of truth for plugin enablement.
  Local skill copies, local skill symlink sets, and the skill-pin lock file
  are not repository source for Hephaestus.
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): `.mcp.json` is the version-controlled
  configuration surface for optional project-scoped agent tooling and remains
  intentionally empty. MCP is not a Hephaestus runtime API or ecosystem
  transport; package and automation operation must not depend on it.
  Plugin marketplaces, NATS JetStream, and HTTP REST remain the maintained
  integration contracts. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md) and
  [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-mcp-integration-posture.md).
- The deferred follow-ups for cross-agent abstraction (a formal `AgentProtocol`)
  and for wiring `hephaestus.resilience` into the GitHub call path are tracked
  in issues #468 and #469.

## Canonical architecture reference

The **canonical unified reference** for the queue-pipeline, stage semantics, ROUTES table, scope trimming, durable journal, worker pool, and observability lives at [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Update the doc (not this file) when the topology changes; this file remains the agent contract and agent-topology map.
