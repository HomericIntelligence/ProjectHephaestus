    2. ``git rebase <remote>/<base_branch> --exec ...`` — replay the PR's commits
       on top of the latest base and run ``git commit --amend --no-edit -S -s``
       after each replayed commit. On conflict, ``git rebase --abort`` restores
       the pre-rebase HEAD so the worktree is left clean for the agent path.

    The caller is expected to push the rebased HEAD with
    :func:`push_current_branch_with_lease_on_divergence` (the rebase rewrites
    history, so a lease push is required).

    Args:
        cwd: Worktree path (already synced to the PR head).
        base_branch: Branch to rebase onto (default ``main``).
        remote: Remote name (default ``origin``).

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the rebase applied cleanly (HEAD may or may not have moved —
        an already-up-to-date PR rebases cleanly to a no-op). ``False`` if the
        rebase hit conflicts and was aborted, signalling the caller to fall back
        to the agent.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the ``git fetch`` fails. A fetch
            failure is a hard error (no current base to rebase onto); the conflict
            case is handled internally and returns ``False`` rather than raising.
