"""GitHub-journal seeding: classify issues into stage queues based on GitHub state.

Part of epic #1809. Reconstructs in-memory queues from GitHub labels and PR state,
the single source of truth for "GitHub is the journal" architecture.

Pure classifier: (labels, PR existence/state) → entry stage, using **ordered label rank**:
- needs-plan(0) < plan-no-go(1) < plan-go(2) < implementation-no-go(3) < implementation-go(4)
- At-or-past comparisons, NEVER equality (verified lesson: `==` strands items already past target)

Entry routing (the binding contract is the classification table in
``docs/architecture.md`` §7 "Seeding and restart reconstruction"):

- ``state:skip`` → excluded (stage ``None``, logged)
- ``state:implementation-blocked`` → excluded until a human resolves the
  implementation hold
- Closed issue + merged PR carrying an exact ``Closes #N`` line → finished
  (pass, idempotent)
- Open PR without an exclusive issue-level ``state:plan-go`` → planning
- Open PR + issue plan-GO + PR-level ``state:implementation-go`` → merge_wait
- Any other open PR with issue plan-GO → pr_review
- No PR, at-or-past ``state:plan-go`` → implementation
- No PR, ``state:plan-no-go`` → planning (amend path)
- No PR, ``state:plan-blocked`` → excluded until an external operator resolves
  the block and replaces the label with exactly one eligible plan state
- ``state:needs-plan`` / no state label → planning

Tracker labels and title inference are candidates, not skip authority. Seeding
routes both through planning so the independent semantic reviewer owns the only
automatic ``state:skip`` transition.

    """Map CLI scope args (``--repos`` / ``--issues`` / ``--prs``) to queue pushes.

    Pure planning plus thin fetch — no mutations:

    - ``repos`` → one :attr:`StageName.REPO` entry each (discovery seeds).
    - ``issues`` → :func:`seed_issue` + :func:`classify_issue` per issue.
    - ``prs`` → tri-state classification mirroring ``classify_issue``'s
      open-PR routing: merged direct PR -> FINISHED (idempotent), closed PR ->
      excluded, open PR with ``state:implementation-go`` -> MERGE_WAIT, open PR
      without it -> PR_REVIEW. A failed state/label fetch reads as
      "open, not yet reviewed" (-> pr_review), matching the existing
      ``_review_existing_pr`` fail-open-to-review semantics.
      When *github* is given (a repo-scoped accessor, e.g.
      :class:`~hephaestus.automation.pipeline_github.PipelineGitHub`), both
      the state read and the label read are scoped to that repo via
      ``github.gh_pr_state`` / ``github.pr_has_implementation_state_label``
      — the same accessor :func:`seed_issue_from_github` uses for
      ``--issues`` — instead of the module-level
      :func:`~hephaestus.automation.github_api.gh_pr_state` /
      :func:`~hephaestus.automation.github_api.gh_pr_label_names`, which
      resolve against the ambient/current repo and can misclassify a PR
      number that collides across repos in a multi-repo run.

    Args:
        repos: Repository names to seed for discovery.
        issues: Issue numbers to classify directly.
        prs: PR numbers to route by merge/close state, then
            implementation-review label.
        github: Optional repo-scoped GitHub accessor for the ``prs`` state
            and label reads. When ``None``, falls back to the ambient
            :func:`~hephaestus.automation.github_api.gh_pr_state` /
            :func:`~hephaestus.automation.github_api.gh_pr_label_names`.
