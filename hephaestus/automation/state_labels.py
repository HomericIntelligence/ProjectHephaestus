"""GitHub issue/PR state-label vocabulary for the automation pipeline.

The automation pipeline uses four mutually-exclusive ``state:*`` labels as the
single source of truth for an issue's plan-review status. This module is the
authoritative definition of those labels, the PR-scoped implementation-review
labels, the independent implementation-intervention latch, and the small
helpers that interpret them; the reviewer, planner, implementer, and the
org-wide provisioning script all import from here.

At most one of the four labels should be present on an issue at any time.
Automation removes ordinary siblings while changing state, but ordinary
transitions never remove ``state:plan-blocked``. If that operator-owned latch
appears during a concurrent transition, exclusive-state confirmation fails and
automation stops until an external actor resolves the block. An authenticated
Athena finalized-plan body is that external resolution: planning may atomically
replace the stale latch with exclusive ``state:plan-go``.

``state:implementation-blocked`` is a separate human-intervention latch. It
can coexist with ``state:plan-go`` and prevents implementation until a human
deliberately changes the issue state.
