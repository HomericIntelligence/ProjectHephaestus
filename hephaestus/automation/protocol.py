"""Canonical comment-body markers used across the automation pipeline.

The planner, plan reviewer, and implementer all locate their comments on a
GitHub issue by ``body.startswith(...)`` against one of two markers:

- :data:`PLAN_COMMENT_MARKER` — the heading the planner writes at the top of
  the single plan comment. ``gh_issue_upsert_comment`` keys off this marker
  to find-and-replace the existing plan rather than appending a new one.
- :data:`PLAN_REVIEW_PREFIX` — the heading the plan reviewer writes at the top
  of each review comment; the verdict gate (:mod:`review_state`) iterates
  comments matching this prefix in chronological order.

Both strings are part of the pipeline's *wire protocol* — changing either
breaks the upsert key and causes duplicate comments. They live here together
so they cannot drift apart.

Originally split across ``models.py`` and ``review_state.py``; consolidated
here per issue #801 (tracking #708).
