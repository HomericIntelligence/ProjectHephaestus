## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report a vulnerability, email **<research@villmow.us>** with:

1. A description of the vulnerability and its impact
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Any relevant code or configuration
4. Your assessment of severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

You can expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and a status update within 7 days.
We will coordinate disclosure timing with you once a fix is available.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

ProjectHephaestus is a **library and CLI utility repository**, not a
network-facing service. Its security posture reflects that scope:

- **Assets**: source-controlled utility code, the optional `automation`
  product layer, and developer credentials passed via environment variables.
- **Trust boundary**: inputs originate from the local developer, CI runners,
  and the GitHub API. There is no public, unauthenticated request surface.
- **In scope**: unsafe deserialization, command/subprocess injection,
  secret leakage, and supply-chain risk in dependencies.
- **Out of scope** (delegated to the *consuming* service): network rate
  limiting, request authentication/authorization, and DoS protection — this
  repo ships no long-running listener that could be flooded.

### Hardening Controls

- **No hardcoded secrets**: Credentials are always read from environment variables
- **Pickle safety**: `load_data` and `save_data` block pickle by default (`allow_unsafe_deserialization=False`)
- **Subprocess safety**: Avoid passing untrusted input to `run_subprocess`; always use list-form commands (never `shell=True`)
- **HTTPS downloads**: All dataset downloads use HTTPS

### Abuse & Rate Limiting

Because this repository exposes no network service, there is no in-process
request rate limiter. The one external-call surface is the GitHub API
(`hephaestus.github`, `hephaestus.automation`); callers there rely on the
GitHub client's built-in retry/backoff and on GitHub's own per-token rate
limits. Downstream services that embed these utilities are responsible for
applying their own rate limiting and abuse controls at their request edge.

### Dependency Suppression Ledger

Known-but-accepted dependency vulnerabilities are tracked in the pip-audit
suppression ledger (`pixi.toml`, `[feature.lint.tasks]`). Every suppression
must carry a re-review trigger; this is enforced at commit time by the
`check-pip-audit-ledger-reminder` pre-commit hook
(`scripts/check_pip_audit_ledger_reminder.py`). The weekly `Security`
workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) re-scans for new vulnerabilities.
