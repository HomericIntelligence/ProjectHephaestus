"""Regression test: MIGRATION.md version claim must not trail the latest git tag.

Pattern D (stop maintaining the number by hand): instead of relying on a human
to notice the dated 'latest released version' line has gone stale, this test
fails CI when the documented version is *older* than the canonical hatch-vcs
version (latest vX.Y.Z git tag). See issue #1208.

This test is designed to RUN in CI, not skip: the unit-test job checks out with
``fetch-tags: true`` (see .github/workflows/test.yml). If tags are somehow
absent, the test FAILS LOUD with remediation guidance rather than skipping --
a guard that silently skips is not a guard.
