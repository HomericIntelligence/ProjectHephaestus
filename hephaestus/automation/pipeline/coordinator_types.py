"""Single-threaded event-loop coordinator for the queue-based pipeline (epic #1809).

## Semantics

The coordinator main thread owns all eight queues, the timer heap, in-flight
jobs, routing, and (through the
:class:`~hephaestus.automation.pipeline_github.PipelineGitHub` accessor) every
GitHub API mutation. The main pool runs agent, test, Git, and network jobs. The
auxiliary pool runs learning and terminal cleanup. Their bounded completion
queues are the only cross-thread channels. An event latch wakes the loop for
accepted completions and signals; callbacks and signal handlers never block on full queues.

Per tick (epic #1809 "Coordinator event loop"):

1. shutdown check (graceful drain, or immediate teardown after the grace
   window / a second signal);
2. wake expired timers (heapq) back into their stage queues;
3. drain ALL ready completions — interrupted results park the item
   RESUMABLE and never advance (``on_job_done`` is never called for them);
4. drain queues DOWNSTREAM-FIRST (finished → learning → merge_wait → pr_review
   → implementation → plan_review → planning → repo; finish work before
   admitting new) with admission control;
5. fully drained: re-seed discovery up to ``--loops``; explicit
   ``--issues``/``--prs`` selections drain once; otherwise block or converge.

``_run_item`` drives ``on_enter``/``step`` until a ``JobRequest`` (park +
submit) or a ``StageOutcome`` (route via ROUTES). Per-item ``try/except``: a
poisoned item routes to finished(fail) and never kills the loop.

Admission control: per-repo in-flight cap (= ``max_workers``), and the
implementation queue is additionally gated by dependency topological order
(:func:`~.admission.order_for_implementation`) and file-overlap serialization
through the coordinator's shared repo-scoped admission pass. Pool size =
``parallel_repos x max_workers``.

### ``--phase-timeout`` queue semantics

This flag bounds each AGENT JOB, not a whole phase subprocess: the coordinator
maps ``phase_timeout_s`` onto ``AgentJob.timeout_s`` at submit time.

### Journal-order invariant

GitHub is the journal: every stage performs its durable mutation immediately
BEFORE returning the outcome that causes a queue push, so restart = re-run
(seeding reconstructs the queues) and interrupts leave every item RESUMABLE
at its stage — never FAILED.

### Rate budget gate

The legacy ``_maybe_sleep_for_rate_budget`` SLEEPS its loop thread — fatal
for a single coordinator thread. Its predicate is ported to a non-blocking
check (:func:`~hephaestus.automation.pipeline_github.rate_budget_ok`); a
low-budget AGENT job is timer-parked until the upstream reset instead of
submitted. Git/build jobs are unaffected.

### Dry-run

Stage accessors log-and-skip mutators; when a stage requests a job the
coordinator logs ``[dry-run] would <descr>`` and ADVANCEs the item instead
of submitting. ``_submit`` asserts no job is EVER submitted in dry-run.

### Interrupts and exit codes

SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP share one shutdown Event: the first signal starts a
graceful drain (grace window, default 30s), the second tears the pool down
immediately and synthesizes interrupted results. Items touched by an
interrupt report ``RESUMABLE at <stage>``, never FAILED. Exit codes: 130
interrupt, 1 any fail/skip/blocked, 0 clean. The summary prints in this
module's ``finally`` — on completion AND interrupt.

When an interrupt overlaps a non-passing ledger entry or fatal coordinator
error, 130 deliberately takes priority because the run did not complete.
