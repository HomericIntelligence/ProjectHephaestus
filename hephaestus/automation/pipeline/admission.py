"""Admission control for the implementation queue.

Part of epic #1809. Provides:

- File-overlap serialization via greedy first-fit partitioning
  (:func:`_select_non_overlapping`, re-housed from ``loop_runner.py``, #1623)
- Dependency-based execution ordering via
  ``DependencyResolver.topological_sort`` (:func:`order_for_implementation`)
- Live dependency checks before implementation dispatch
  (:func:`dependency_block_reason`)
- Closed-issue filtering for explicit ``--issues`` lists
  (:func:`_filter_open_issues`, #1576)

The file-overlap guard (#1623) prevents concurrent plan execution on the same
source files, which would lead to merge conflicts when the first PR lands.

Dropped deliverable (documented): the per-repo in-flight cap helper
(``within_repo_cap``) is intentionally NOT implemented. The issue #1813
"# Implementation Plan" comment sanctions the drop: "justify or drop
``within_repo_cap`` (YAGNI — no named consumer)" — the cap is owned by
:meth:`~hephaestus.automation.pipeline.coordinator.Coordinator._admit`, where
the coordinator slice tracks per-repo worker slots and applies the cap at
dispatch time.
