"""Strict plan review loop for :class:`Planner`.

Owns the bounded ``plan → capture learnings → review`` iteration cycle that
runs per issue:

1. Pre-fetch issue + run advise once before the loop.
2. Up to :data:`MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` iterations of
   ``_generate_plan → _capture_planner_learnings → _run_plan_review``.
3. Stop on the first unambiguous GO; otherwise feed the review back and
   re-plan.

Extracted from ``planner.py`` (#598) so the coordinator class stays focused
on the worker-pool driver. No behavior change.

            learnings: Planner-captured learnings for this iteration.
            iteration: Iteration index (0, 1, or 2).
            prior_review: Previous iteration's review text, or ``None`` on iter 0.

        Returns:
            Review text. On reviewer-call failure, returns a synthetic NoGo
            review so the loop can continue (failing safe — never silently GO).
