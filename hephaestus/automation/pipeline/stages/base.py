"""Base protocol and step-result types for pipeline stages.

This module defines the :class:`Stage` protocol that all pipeline stages
implement, the step-result types (:class:`Continue` / :class:`JobRequest` /
re-exported :class:`StageOutcome`), and :class:`StageContext`, the bundle of
coordinator-owned accessors injected into every stage call.

Core types come from their source modules (epic #1809):
``StageOutcome``/``Disposition``/``StageName`` from :mod:`..routing`,
``WorkItem``/``ItemKind`` from :mod:`..work_item`, and
``AgentJob``/``JobResult``/``JobHandle`` from :mod:`..jobs`. They are
re-exported here so stage modules and their tests have a single import
surface for the stage contract.

Coordinator convention (binding for #1817, the coordinator slice):

- ``on_enter`` runs once when an item enters the stage. It must be
  idempotent, and its label checks are ordered at-or-past checks (never
  equality), so re-entry after a restart fast-forwards instead of redoing
  work. It returns ``None`` to proceed or a ``StageOutcome`` to route away.
- ``step`` is invoked for the item's *current* ``state``. Returning
  ``Continue`` advances ``item.state`` and steps again; returning
  ``JobRequest`` submits the job while ``item.state`` stays at the
  submitting WAIT state; returning ``StageOutcome`` routes via ROUTES.
- When a requested job completes and was NOT interrupted, the coordinator
  calls ``on_job_done`` (``item.state`` still the WAIT state that submitted
  the job), then sets ``item.state = on_done_state`` and steps again.
  ``on_job_done`` is never called for interrupted results — interrupts
  leave items resumable, never failed.
- Timer-park (RETRY delay) contract: ``StageOutcome`` has NO delay field,
  so a stage that returns ``StageOutcome(Disposition.RETRY, ...)`` for a
  non-blocking poll records the backoff delay in
  ``item.payload["retry_delay_s"]`` immediately before returning. The
  coordinator (#1817) consumes ``payload["retry_delay_s"]`` to park the
  item on its timer heap and re-steps it after that many seconds (a
  missing key means "retry on the next drain tick"). Stages NEVER sleep —
  the heap owns every wait.
- All durable GitHub mutations go through ``ctx.github`` and happen
  immediately BEFORE the outcome that causes a queue push ("durable write
  precedes the queue push").
- ``ctx.github`` implements the :class:`StageGitHub` protocol. Its mutator
  surface (``add_labels`` / ``remove_labels`` / ``close_issue_as_covered`` /
  ``upsert_plan_comment``) uses coordinator-neutral names the coordinator
  (#1817) maps onto the ``github_api`` mutators; ``upsert_plan_comment`` is
  the durable plan-comment channel (doc section 2: "plan comment = durable
  artifact") — the planning stage calls it in VERIFY so the plan the agent
  produced is journaled BEFORE the verify/ADVANCE decision.
