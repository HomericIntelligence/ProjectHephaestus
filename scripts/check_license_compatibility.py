"""Fail CI when a *distributed* dependency's license is incompatible with BSD-3-Clause.

NOTICE holds the authoritative human-readable analysis. This script is the
machine-enforced subset: every dependency the project DISTRIBUTES (base deps +
runtime extras, NEVER `dev`) must carry a permissive license or be a
NOTICE-justified non-vendored extra (pygithub/LGPL, defusedxml/PSF).

Scope = distributed deps only, read from the installed package's Requires-Dist.
Dev tooling (yamllint/bats are GPL, see NOTICE) is never examined.

FAILS LOUDLY (never silently passes):
  * empty/missing Requires-Dist -> the gate cannot see its inputs -> exit 2
  * a declared distributed dep with no resolvable metadata (extra not installed)
    -> coverage hole -> exit 2. CI installs `.[all]` on a setup-python runner first.
  * a license string not in the mapping tables -> exit (PR:1 / main:0) with a
    hint to extend TROVE_TO_SPDX / LICENSE_ALIASES.
  * a markered-out dep (installable_now=False) with no entry in
    STATIC_FALLBACK_LICENSES -> exit 2. Add the package + SPDX id from NOTICE,
    then update the cross-check tests in tests/unit/scripts/.

Stdlib only (importlib.metadata + packaging, both already runtime deps); runs
under plain `python3` once the package + extras are pip-installed.

Advisory on main/schedule (exit 0), blocking on pull_request (exit 1).
