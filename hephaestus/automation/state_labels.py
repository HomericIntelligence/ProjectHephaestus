"""GitHub issue/PR state-label vocabulary for the automation pipeline.

The automation pipeline uses three mutually-exclusive ``state:*`` labels as the
single source of truth for an issue's plan-review status. This module is the
authoritative definition of those labels, the PR-scoped implementation-review
labels, and the small helpers that interpret them; the reviewer, planner,
implementer, and the org-wide provisioning script all import from here.

At most one of the three labels should be present on an issue at any time;
each apply-state helper removes the other two as it sets its own.

#: available signal — see :func:`is_epic`.

#: Per-label colour (hex without leading ``#``) and short description. The
