# ProjectHephaestus Roadmap

## Vision

ProjectHephaestus is the foundational utilities and tooling repository of the HomericIntelligence ecosystem, providing standardized components that support development across all other projects. We prioritize modularity, reliability, and consistency across a diverse set of cross-cutting concerns: configuration management, logging, GitHub automation, and agent coordination.

## Current Focus (Q2 2026)

The strict 2026-04-28 repository audit (Epic #310) is now **closed**. The active work is remediating findings from the follow-up strict 2026-05-28 audit, tracked as individual `audit-finding` issues. This ongoing work spans:

1. **Audit Remediation** — Addressing the open `audit-finding` issues across the 15 audit dimensions. Focus areas include documentation currency, automation module test coverage, fixing f-string logging anti-patterns, and continued hardening of the 3-stage review-PR pipeline (collapsed from the prior 6-phase design in #677/#679).

2. **Automation Package Stabilization** — Refactoring and hardening the automation modules (PR review, CI driver, issue implementation) to improve single responsibility, observability, and idempotency. This includes fixing critical bugs in the CI state machine and worktree management.

3. **CLI Tool Coverage Expansion** — Expanding the CLI entry point test suite from 13 of 47 declared tools to full coverage, ensuring all command-line interfaces are properly validated.

4. **Test Coverage Hardening** — Bringing 12 excluded automation modules into coverage measurement with mocked unit tests for core orchestration logic.

5. **Security & Dependency Management** — Hard-blocking pip-audit failures in CI and resolving dependency consistency issues across pixi.toml and pyproject.toml.

## Near-term (Next 1-2 Quarters)

Assuming audit remediation is complete:

1. **Multi-platform CI Support** — Extend GitHub Actions test matrix to include macOS and Windows alongside Ubuntu, addressing the gap between pixi.toml multi-platform claims and CI reality (#321 context).

2. **Cross-Repository Coverage** — Expand hephaestus utility adoption across other HomericIntelligence projects. Standardize configuration loading, logging setup, and subprocess execution patterns.

3. **API Surface Documentation** — Auto-generate API reference documentation for all public modules, including stable subpackage surfaces and complete CLI reference.

4. **Observability and Health Checks** — Add structured health reporting for long-running components (e.g., NATSSubscriberThread), supporting the broader ProjectArgus (observability) initiative.

## Long-term (4+ Quarters Out)

Conservative, directional items:

1. **Agent Coordination Framework** — Explore deeper integration with ProjectMyrmidons for agent swarm coordination patterns, building on existing entry points for orchestration.

2. **Benchmark Suite Expansion** — Enhance the benchmark comparison utilities to support cross-project performance tracking and regression detection.

3. **Configuration Ecosystem** — Investigate dynamic configuration patterns (ProjectProteus integration) and configuration composition across multiple environments.

## How We Plan

ProjectHephaestus uses an Epic-and-children issue pattern for project planning. Major initiatives are tracked as Epic issues (labeled `epic`), with breakdown into concrete child issues tagged by audit section and severity.

**Exemplar:** Epic #310 (Strict audit 2026-04-28, now closed) contained 29 child issues spanning all 15 audit dimensions, with clear scoping and evidence-based requirements.

We also capture session learnings in ProjectMnemosyne via the `/learn` skill, preserving team knowledge about patterns, anti-patterns, and decisions across the ecosystem.

## Updating This Roadmap

**Cadence — release-driven, not date-driven.** A "release cycle" is not a
calendar interval; it is each `vX.Y.Z` release cut through the **Auto Tag
Release** workflow (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). Because that workflow is
triggered manually when a batch of features/fixes is ready — not on a fixed
schedule — releases (and therefore roadmap reviews) are **feature/fix-driven,
not date-driven**. Cadence in practice tracks release frequency rather than a
fixed monthly rhythm.

**Trigger.** The roadmap is reviewed as part of the pre-release checklist,
whenever a release is cut. Any Epic being opened or closed, or a shift in
priorities, is also a valid trigger to refresh it between releases.

**Responsibility.** The maintainer cutting the release owns the roadmap review
for that cycle: confirming the "Current Focus" section still reflects open
Epics and updating the "Last updated" date below. In this solo/small-team repo
that is the release maintainer; there is no separate roadmap committee.

**How to propose changes.** Open an issue that references this document (or a
PR editing it directly). The roadmap is refreshed to reflect current focus
areas as Epics are created or priorities shift.
