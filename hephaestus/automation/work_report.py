"""Work report file protocol for loop runner (#613).

The loop runner injects HEPH_WORK_REPORT (a temp file path) into subprocess
envs. Phases that understand the contract write their work-unit count to that
file. The runner reads the file after the subprocess returns to measure
convergence.

No-op when the env var is unset (phase run outside the loop runner).
