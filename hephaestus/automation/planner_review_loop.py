"""Strict plan review loop for :class:`Planner`.

Owns the bounded ``plan → capture learnings → review`` iteration cycle that
runs per issue:

1. Pre-fetch issue + run advise once before the loop.
2. Up to :data:`MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` iterations of
   ``_generate_plan → _capture_planner_learnings → _run_plan_review``.
3. Stop on the first unambiguous GO; otherwise feed the review back and
   re-plan.

Extracted from ``planner.py`` (#598) so the coordinator class stays focused
on the worker-pool driver. No behavior change.

        Resumes the planner's own session (``AGENT_PLANNER``) rather than

        the plan it just wrote and can introspect its own reasoning rather

        The reviewer's session is distinct from the planner's (different

        session via :func:`reviewer_agent` (the ``-r{iteration}`` token) so the
