"""Regression test: ROADMAP.md must define an explicit iteration cadence.

Issue #1493 (S10 Planning, MODULARITY): the roadmap previously said it was
"reviewed and updated at the end of each release cycle (typically monthly)"
without defining the trigger, whether releases are date- or feature-driven,
or who owns the review. This guard fails if that section regresses to vague
prose. It asserts the HARD invariant (required phrases are present), never an
unverifiable cadence value like "monthly".
