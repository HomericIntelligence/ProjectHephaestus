    Entries expire ``ttl_seconds`` after they are stored (measured with
    ``time.monotonic`` so it is immune to wall-clock changes). All cache
    access is guarded by a single ``threading.Lock``.

    The ``compute`` callable in :meth:`get_or_compute` runs *outside* the lock
    so a slow producer for one key does not block readers/writers of other
    keys. The deliberate consequence is that several threads racing the SAME
    cold key may each run ``compute`` once (a bounded, idempotent-read
    thundering herd); the final store is last-writer-wins and all callers
    receive an equal value. A ``compute`` that raises propagates and stores
    nothing — failures are never memoized, matching the prior dict-cache
    behavior of only caching successes.
