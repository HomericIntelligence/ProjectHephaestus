"""Regression guard: each phase module passes the correct AGENT_* constant.

The phase modules split into two categories:

- **Self-agent phases** (`plan_reviewer`, `pr_reviewer`, `implementer`,
  `ci_driver`) own their own session identity — each passes its dedicated
  ``AGENT_*`` constant to ``invoke_claude_with_session`` so its session UUID
  is distinct from every other phase's. ``ci_driver`` owns Session 3
  (``AGENT_CI_DRIVER``): drive-green polls CI, runs its own fix sessions, and
  captures its own learnings on a transcript independent of the implementer.
- **Continuation phases** (`address_review`) deliberately resume the
  implementer's session. Address-review applies code fixes to satisfy PR
  review feedback, continuing the same line of work the implementer started,
  so it passes ``AGENT_IMPLEMENTER`` to land on the same session UUID. This is
  intentional and is the mechanism that gives that phase a warm prompt cache.

These tests assert source-text properties (not runtime mock behavior)
because constructing valid Options objects for every phase is brittle and
orthogonal to what we want to guard: that the *wiring* is correct.
