# Contributing to Hephaestus

Thank you for considering contributing to Hephaestus! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [HomericIntelligence Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Your first day

New here? This is the shortest path from a fresh clone to a merged PR. Each step
links to the full section below.

1. **Set up the environment** ([Development Setup](#development-setup)) — install
   uv, then `just bootstrap` (one command: deps + editable install + pre-commit
   hooks).
2. **Confirm the toolchain works** — run `just check` (lint + format-check +
   typecheck) and `just test`. Green here means your machine is ready.
3. **Pick an issue** ([Code Contributions](#code-contributions)) — pick or open a
   GitHub issue, then branch as `<issue-number>-description`.
4. **Make the change test-first** ([Testing](#testing)) — write a failing test,
   make it pass, and run each new or changed test before you create the PR. Keep
   coverage at the configured floor in
   [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) while working toward the target in
   [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
5. **Open the PR** ([Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process)) — use a
   Conventional Commit PR title, sign every commit (`git commit -S`), put
   `Closes #<issue-number>` on its own line in the body, and keep auto-merge
   disabled. `$athena:pr-review` output is audit
   evidence, not authorization. The loop applies `state:implementation-go`
   only after a structural audit and fresh live GitHub facts confirm the exact
   open, unarmed reviewed head, complete thread state, and exclusive label
   transition by readback. `merge_wait` then revalidates the in-memory
   reviewed-head proof and conditionally squash-merges that exact head without
   mutating native auto-merge. Normal review may collect CI/CD evidence as
   context, but the loop does not change CI/CD. Required CI/CD checks are the
   merge contract; review prose does not independently authorize a merge. Do
   not enable auto-merge manually.

If anything in steps 1–2 fails, see [Platform Support](#platform-support) for
the supported Python versions and platform-specific test behavior.

## Planning artifacts

Before opening a PR, locate the work in:

- [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — current and planned releases.
- [`docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) — the
  completion bar every PR is reviewed against.
- [`docs/TECH_DEBT.md`](docs/TECH_DEBT.md) — debt-tracking convention
  and `wontfix` gate.
- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) — bug and
  feature templates.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)
  — the PR scaffolding (`Closes #N` line is enforced by the
  `pr-policy` CI gate).
- [`docs/documentation-maintenance.md`](docs/documentation-maintenance.md) —
  ownership, sources, review triggers, and automated guards for living docs.

Hephaestus uses trunk-based development: create one short-lived feature
branch per issue, open a pull request, squash-merge it back to `main`, and cut
releases from signed `vX.Y.Z` tags; there are no release branches.

Keep PRs small: prefer one issue per PR so each change can be reviewed
and reverted independently. As a rough guide, aim to keep PRs under
~500 changed lines (XS <10 · S <50 · M <250 · L <500 · XL 500+); split
larger PRs unless the change is inherently atomic. Every PR is reviewed
against the [Definition of Done](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md). Releases
are cut on demand by pushing a signed `vX.Y.Z` git tag (see
[`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md)).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Describe the bug clearly
- Include steps to reproduce
- Mention your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Explain the enhancement in detail
- Provide use cases
- If possible, suggest implementation approaches

### Code Contributions

1. Open (or pick up) a GitHub issue describing the change.
2. Create a feature branch named `<issue-number>-description`.
3. Make your changes.
4. Write/update tests.
5. Run each new or changed test and make sure that it passes.
6. Update documentation.
7. Submit a pull request — see [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) below.

## Development Setup

1. Install uv: <https://uv.sh/install/>
2. Clone your fork
3. Bootstrap the project (installs deps, the editable package, and pre-commit
   hooks in one step): `just bootstrap`

   `just bootstrap` wraps `uv sync` and `uv run pre-commit install`. If you do
   not have [`just`](https://just.systems/) installed, run those two commands
   manually instead.
4. Run project commands through the managed environment, for example `just test`.
5. Before pushing, run the fast quality gate: `just check`
   (lint + format-check + typecheck). Run `just --list` to see every recipe.

### Secret-scanning failures

The mandatory `gitleaks` pre-commit hook scans every staged change with generic
secret rules, even when the optional operator-local `.heph-private-denylist`
does not exist. Handle a finding as follows:

1. Treat it as a real credential first: remove it from the change and rotate or
   revoke it if it was ever usable.
2. For synthetic fixtures or examples, replace the value with a placeholder
   that cannot be mistaken for a credential.
3. If an exact non-secret value must remain, add `gitleaks:allow` only to that
   specific line and explain the exception in the pull request. Do not use
   `SKIP=gitleaks` or `--no-verify`.
4. If the pinned scanner release has a tool-wide regression, roll both the
   pre-commit revision and the CI image back to the previous known-good
   Gitleaks release in a reviewed PR while keeping the hook enabled. Remove
   temporary line-scoped exceptions after the regression is resolved.

### Platform Support

The uv developer environment and the published wheel intentionally cover
different platform sets. Contributors and downstream users should know which
they are using:

| Install path                        | Platforms supported                    | Python      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `uv sync` (development) | Linux, macOS, Windows | 3.13 (see `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`) |
| `pip install HomericIntelligence-Hephaestus` (wheel) | Linux, macOS, Windows (any OS) | 3.13 (see `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`) |

Platform notes:

- **uv manages the development environment on every platform supported by its
  selected Python interpreter.** The project requires Python 3.13; `uv sync`
  installs the editable checkout and the default development groups.
- **Required CI currently runs on Linux.** Native-Windows runs skip tests marked
  `requires_posix`; Linux, macOS, and WSL run those POSIX subprocess checks.
- **The wheel supports the same Python range.** `requires-python` in
  `pyproject.toml` describes what `pip install` accepts; no platform-restriction
  classifier is published.
- **Windows wheels pull in `tzdata` automatically.** The
  `"tzdata>=2026.2,<2027; platform_system == 'Windows'"` marker in
  `[project.dependencies]` exists because `hephaestus.github.rate_limit` uses
  `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`, which has no IANA database bundled on Windows. POSIX
  installs skip this dependency.

Use `uv sync` to develop and run the test suite on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
Native-Windows runs skip only the tests explicitly marked `requires_posix`; do
not substitute a second environment manager for the uv workflow.

### The `build/` directory

`build/` is gitignored **automation scratch**, not packaging output. The
automation loop writes work reports, loop logs, and audit artifacts there
(see `hephaestus/automation/loop_runner.py`). Despite the name, no build or
distribution artifacts come from it — the sdist `only-include` allowlist in
`pyproject.toml` excludes it. Never `git add` anything under `build/`; the
`check-build-dir-untracked` pre-commit hook enforces this (issue #1214). To
clear local scratch, stop any running automation loop first, then
`git clean -fdX build/` (removes only ignored files).

## Code Style

We follow these style guidelines:

- Python code: Formatted and linted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- Type hints: Required for all public functions (enforced by mypy strict mode)
- Line length: 100 characters
- Target Python: 3.13
- English technical prose: Follow the
  [ASD-STE100 writing standard](docs/asd-ste100.md)

Run the development tools:

```bash
uv run ruff format hephaestus scripts tests
uv run ruff check hephaestus scripts tests
```

## Testing

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for complex features
- Maintain or improve code coverage

Before you create a pull request, run each new or changed test. Use the narrowest
pytest command that collects all tests that your change adds or revises. Check
the pytest summary to make sure that the command collected those tests. For
example:

```bash
uv run pytest --override-ini="addopts=" tests/unit/utils/test_general_utils.py -v
```

The override clears the default fast selection so the named tests can run.
Use the paths for your changed tests. `just test` runs the fast selection used by pre-commit and pull-request
CI. Nightly CI runs the remaining functional, package, shell, and coverage
tests.

For a manual contribution, finish the implementation and rebase the branch on
the current `origin/main`. If the rebase or conflict resolution changes a file,
run each affected test again. Run the full locked local suite after this final
rebase and before you push:

```bash
uv run --locked pytest tests/unit tests/integration --override-ini="addopts=" -v --strict-markers -m "not performance and not contract and not artifact and not codex_release_artifact"
```

The test result must apply to the final pushed head. Run this suite again only
if the branch head changes. The checks in [Your first day](#your-first-day)
verify the development environment. They do not verify a later branch change.

The automation loop uses the rebase policy in
[ADR-0047](docs/adr/0047-automation-rebase-triggers.md). It prepares the branch
before implementation and does not do a routine final rebase. An operator can
request the explicit `--rebase` path.

### Test environment requirements

The unit-test suite executes a small number of real subprocesses and therefore
assumes a POSIX-like development environment. Specifically:

- **`echo`, `false`, `ls`** on `PATH` — used by `tests/unit/automation/test_git_utils.py::TestRun`
  to exercise the `run()` wrapper end-to-end (four cases).
- **`git`** on `PATH` — used by `tests/unit/automation/test_session_naming.py`
  (`TestShortGithash::test_real_repo` and
  `TestCurrentTrunkGithash::test_falls_back_to_short_githash`) to create a
  throwaway repo inside `tmp_path` with `git init -q` and `git commit
  --allow-empty --no-gpg-sign`. Git environment variables (`GIT_DIR`,
  `GIT_WORK_TREE`, etc.) are scrubbed and author/committer identity is forced
  via `_git_test_env()` so the tests do not depend on the contributor's
  `~/.gitconfig`.

These cases are tagged with the `requires_posix` pytest marker and are skipped
automatically on `sys.platform == "win32"`. They run under macOS, Linux, and
WSL with no extra setup beyond `uv sync`. Windows contributors using Git
Bash / MSYS2 will execute them; pure-Windows-Python runs will skip them.
Tracking: #742.

The command `bash scripts/run_ci_local.sh build` also requires `python3` and
`zstd` on `PATH`. It uses these tools to provision and extract the fixed Codex
artifact before the network-free artifact test starts.

## Documentation

- Update docstrings for code changes
- Add sections to README.md for new features
- Keep documentation clear and concise

## Version Management

The project uses **hatch-vcs dynamic versioning** — the version is derived from
git tags, not stored in a file:

- **Single source of truth**: the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag. `pyproject.toml` declares
  `dynamic = ["version"]` with `[tool.hatch.version]` `source = "vcs"`; there is no
  static `[project].version`.
- **`pyproject.toml` has no version field** — this is intentional. A pre-commit hook
  (`check-version-single-source`) rejects a `version` field in either file.

### Releasing a new version

You do not edit a version field. A release is cut by the signed Auto Tag Release
workflow — see [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) for the full workflow.
`hephaestus-bump-version` is compute-only for static projects and fails closed
for hatch-vcs/tag-derived projects; it never writes `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`,
or `hephaestus/__init__.py`.

## Dependency Updates

- **Dependabot** owns the root Python dependency lifecycle through the `uv`
  ecosystem in [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml):
  `pyproject.toml` declarations and the committed `uv.lock`. It opens grouped
  Python dependency PRs monthly and also manages `github-actions` updates.
- Refresh the lockfile deliberately when updating dependencies:

  ```bash
  uv lock --upgrade
  uv sync
  ```

  Review and commit the resulting `uv.lock` together with any corresponding
  `pyproject.toml` change. `uv lock --check` is the CI consistency check.

### Python dependency and `uv.lock` lifecycle

`uv.lock` is committed and must remain synchronized with the dependency
declarations in `pyproject.toml`. Dependabot owns the routine monthly updates;
when changing dependencies manually, regenerate and commit `uv.lock` with the
same change:

```bash
uv lock                                  # resolve declared dependency changes
uv lock --upgrade-package <name>         # upgrade one package deliberately
uv lock --upgrade                         # upgrade all packages deliberately
uv lock --check                           # verify the committed lock is fresh
```

The `uv lock --check` pre-commit hook runs for `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
changes and is enforced by the required CI lint job. The check is read-only;
use one of the update commands above to refresh the lock before committing.

## Pull Request Process

The `main` branch is protected. The active `homeric-main-baseline` ruleset
blocks unsigned commits. CI's `pr-policy` gate separately enforces the issue
reference, the Conventional Commit PR title and branch subjects, and DCO
sign-offs:

1. **Reference the issue**: the PR body must contain the literal line `Closes #<n>`
   (capital `C`, no colon, on its own line). `Fixes`, `Resolves`, `closes`, and
   `Closes:` are **not** accepted.
2. **Use a Conventional Commit PR title**:
   `type(scope)!: concise description`. The title becomes the `main` subject
   when the PR is squash-merged. Every authored branch commit follows the same
   form; see the [Definition of Done](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) for the
   narrow Git-generated exceptions and the pre-#2157 history cutover.
3. **Sign off every commit**: include a DCO `Signed-off-by` trailer, normally
   with `git commit -s -S`.

Do not enable auto-merge manually. The queue applies
`state:implementation-go` only after a structural audit and fresh live GitHub
facts confirm the PR's exact open, unarmed reviewed head, complete thread
state, and exclusive label transition by readback. `$athena:pr-review` prose,
grades, and decision-shaped output are audit evidence, not authorization.
`merge_wait` consumes the loop-owned label together with its in-memory
reviewed-head proof and conditionally squash-merges that exact head; it does
not create, disable, adopt, or poll an auto-merge request. A restart has no
proof and returns the PR to review without mutating labels. Normal review may
collect CI/CD evidence as context, but the loop does not change CI/CD. Required
CI/CD checks are the merge contract and do not independently authorize the
loop-owned approval transition.

Before you create the PR, run each new or changed test and verify that pytest
collects it and reports success. Keep commits to logical units with
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) messages. Never
bypass pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`. The pre-commit suite does not run
pytest; required CI/CD runs the full test suites.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By contributing, you certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/):
you have the right to submit the work under this project's open-source license and you agree it may be
distributed under those terms. You record that legal grant by adding a `Signed-off-by` trailer to **every**
commit:

```bash
git commit -s -S -m "type(scope): description"
```

This is **distinct** from the cryptographic signature requirement above, and both are required:

- **`-s` (`Signed-off-by:` trailer)** — the *DCO*. A legal attestation that you have the right to
  contribute the change and license it inbound to the project. It proves *provenance of the grant*.
- **`-S` (GPG/SSH signature)** — *cryptographic authorship/integrity*. It proves *who* authored the
  commit and that its contents were not tampered with. The `homeric-main-baseline` ruleset enforces `-S`.

You can set them together so you never forget:

```bash
git config commit.gpgsign true   # always -S
# add the sign-off per commit with -s (or via a prepare-commit-msg hook)
```

Both are now mechanically enforced: the `pr-policy` CI gate (Check 3) fails any PR
whose commits lack a valid `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` trailer, and the local
`dco-signoff-msg` `commit-msg` pre-commit hook rejects an un-signed-off commit
before it is created. To re-sign existing commits run:

```bash
git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -s' origin/main
```
