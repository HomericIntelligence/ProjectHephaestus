"""Multi-repo, multi-stage automation loop driver.

Replaces ``scripts/run_automation_loop.sh``. Iterates over all
non-archived HomericIntelligence repos. Per loop iteration, runs the
2-phase iteration body (``plan`` → ``implement``) ``--loops`` times per
repo. After the loop body finishes (whether by exhaustion or early-exit),
runs the post-loop terminal stages (``drive-green``) **once per repo**.

Plan-review, PR-review, and address-review are no longer standalone phases —
the planner owns its review loop and the implementer absorbs PR-review +
thread-addressing in-loop (#455/#468/#484). ``drive-green`` was promoted
from "third loop phase, final-loop only" to "post-loop terminal stage" in
#818 — it is a per-repo terminal action, not an iteration step.

The key correctness invariant — and the reason this replaces the bash
version — is that each phase is a plain ``subprocess.run`` call inside a
Python ``for`` loop. Phase N failing returns a ``PhaseResult(rc=N)`` and
control unconditionally proceeds to phase N+1. No shell-option landmine
(``set -e`` / ``set -m`` / subshell exec-optimization) can silently skip
the rest of the pipeline.

CLI is flag-compatible with the previous bash script so operator muscle
memory and any pinned callers keep working.
