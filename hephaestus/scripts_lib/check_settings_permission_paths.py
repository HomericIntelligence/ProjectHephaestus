r"""Guard: permission paths in ``.claude/settings.json`` are canonical POSIX paths.

An audit (issue #1495) found a ``Read(//home/...)`` double-slash prefix in a
machine-local settings file. Double-slash or backslash prefixes may match
differently than intended under prefix-based allowlist matching, silently
granting or denying access the author did not intend (POLA). This guard makes
any such artifact in the *tracked* ``.claude/settings.json`` fail CI.

The audit's named file — ``.claude/settings.local.json`` — is gitignored,
untracked, and absent from the repository, so it cannot be edited in a PR. The
durable, reviewable fix is therefore a guard over the tracked settings file:
any future ``//``- or ``\``-prefixed permission path lands where a reviewer
and CI can catch it.

Usage:
    python3 -m hephaestus.scripts_lib.check_settings_permission_paths
