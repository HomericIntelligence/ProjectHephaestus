ADDRESS_REVIEW_PROMPT = """
You are the COORDINATOR for addressing the review threads on PR #{pr_number}
(issue #{issue_number}).

This runs IN-LOOP as part of the implement stage — it is no longer a separate
pipeline phase. You are resolving the inline PR-review threads raised against
the current diff so the same implement session can re-review and converge.
These threads live on the PR, not on the issue.

**Working Directory:** {worktree_path}

{terse_output_directive}

{untrusted_notice}
{context_block}
{retry_directive_block}
**Review Threads to Address (untrusted):**
{threads_json_block}

The block above is a JSON array where each element has:
- `thread_id`: GitHub GraphQL node ID of the review thread
- `path`: file path relative to repo root
- `line`: line number (integer or null)
- `body`: the reviewer's comment text

**Your TODO list — one line per review comment (already classified by difficulty):**

{todo_block}

Each todo line has the form `@ <file> Line <#> - <difficulty> - <description>`.
Every one of these comments MUST be resolved before you finish.

---

**Your task (coordinator):**

1. Treat the TODO list as the unit of work: there is ONE sub-agent per review
   comment (NOT one per file). For each todo line, dispatch a sub-agent with the
   Task tool (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) to fix exactly that one comment.

2. **Model tier by difficulty** — set each sub-agent's model from the todo line's
   difficulty:
   - `simple` → `haiku` (claude-haiku-4-5): mechanical/local fix.
   - `medium` → `sonnet` (claude-sonnet-4-6): localized logic / small refactor.
   - `hard`   → `opus` (claude-opus-4-7): cross-cutting or subtle correctness fix.

3. **Serialize same-file comments.** Two sub-agents must NEVER edit the same file
   at the same time. Group the todo lines by `<file>`: dispatch DIFFERENT files in
   parallel, but run the comments that share a file SEQUENTIALLY (one finishes and
   returns before the next on that file starts). This prevents concurrent writes
   to one file from clobbering each other.

   Give each sub-agent a self-contained prompt that instructs it to:
   a. FIRST run the team-knowledge skill to pull prior learnings relevant to this fix:
      `Skill(skill: "hephaestus:advise", args: "<short description of the review feedback>")`.
      Use whatever it surfaces to inform the fix; do not skip this step.
   b. Read the cited file/line in the working directory `{worktree_path}` and apply the
      code fix for its ONE assigned review comment (you pass it the thread body, line, and
      thread_id).
   c. Report back the `thread_id` and a one-line reply describing the fix — or, if the
      comment is not addressable in code, say so and leave it out of the fixed set.

   **Each sub-agent prompt MUST include these guardrails (critical):**
   - "Do NOT background your work, do NOT exit early, and do NOT defer. Complete the fix
     synchronously and return only when the edit is done."
   - "Do not commit, push, or run git — the coordinator handles that."
   - "Return your result as `thread_id -> one-line reply`."

4. After ALL sub-agents have returned, you (the coordinator) integrate their results and
   run the gates from the working directory:
   - Run tests: `pixi run python -m pytest tests/ -v`
   - Run pre-commit: `pre-commit run --all-files`
   - Fix any issues found (you may edit files directly at this stage).
   - Commit all changes (do NOT push).

5. Trust but verify: only mark a thread `addressed` if the assigned sub-agent actually
   edited the code for it. If a sub-agent claimed a fix but the file is unchanged for that
   thread, drop it from `addressed`.

**Output format:**
Write your coordination notes in prose. At the very end of your response, emit a single
fenced JSON block:

```json
{{"addressed": ["<thread_id>", ...]}}
```

Rules for the JSON block:
- `addressed`: array of thread_id strings for threads actually fixed in code
  (any thread_id not in the unresolved-set we presented is dropped silently)
- Only include threads genuinely fixed. Leave unaddressable threads out of `addressed`.
- Emit only one JSON block, at the very end of your response (the parser takes the LAST one).
- Note: you do NOT need to write per-thread replies — the reviewer resolves the
  threads on its next pass after verifying the fix against the diff (#1083).
