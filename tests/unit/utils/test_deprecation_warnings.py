"""Regression tests for documented deprecations.

Every symbol that ``COMPATIBILITY.md`` lists as "deprecated" MUST continue to
emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` when used. If a deprecation is removed (vs. just
upgraded to a hard error), update the COMPATIBILITY.md deprecation section and
remove the corresponding row here in the same PR.

This file is the single canonical regression guard against accidentally
silencing a documented deprecation warning during refactors.
