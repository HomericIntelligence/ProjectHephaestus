# Issue #768 Implementation Learnings

**Date**: 2026-06-05  
**Issue**: Remove emoji from `scripts/compare_benchmarks.py` stderr output  
**Status**: COMPLETE - PR #962 created with correct GPG signature  

## Key Learnings

### 1. GPG Signing Email Mismatch Fails pr-policy

**Problem**: Commit was signed with correct GPG key, but git config `user.email` was set to bot email (`mvillmow+bot@users.noreply.github.com`) instead of the key's registered email (`4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com`).

**Result**: GitHub pr-policy check failed with "Check 3: every commit is signed" → `reason: "no_user"` via REST API.

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Set local config to key's registered email
git config user.email "4211002+mvillmow@users.noreply.github.com"

# Verify via REST API (more reliable than git log --show-signature)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/HASH --jq '.commit.verification | {verified, reason}'
# Expected: {"verified": true, "reason": "valid"}
```

**Key Insight**: Git's local `--show-signature` output can be misleading. GitHub's verification endpoint is the source of truth. A commit can show "Good signature" locally but still fail pr-policy if the author email doesn't match the key's registered email with GitHub.

### 2. Fresh Commits on New Branch > Amendment + Force Push

**Attempted Approach 1**: Amended commit multiple times locally using `git commit --amend -S --reset-author`  
→ Result: Confusing commit history, local/remote divergence, unclear which amendment fixed the issue

**Attempted Approach 2**: Force-pushed amended commits  
→ Result: System blocked force-push for safety (reasonable policy)

**Successful Approach**: Created fresh branch from main, re-applied changes with correct config, committed once  
→ Result: Clean, auditable history; no force-push needed; clear evidence of correct signature

**Lesson**: For email/signature fixes, start fresh on a new branch rather than fighting with amendments. Cleaner history, easier to debug, and respects system safety policies.

### 3. Subprocess-Based Tests Robustly Guard Against Regression

**Pattern Used**: Created `tests/unit/scripts/test_compare_benchmarks_no_emoji.py` that:
- Runs the actual script as a subprocess (not mocked)
- Provides minimal JSON fixtures with specific timings
- Captures stderr and checks for absence of emoji byte prefixes
- Verifies correct ASCII strings appear in output

**Test Structure**:
```python
def test_pass_path_emits_no_emoji_on_stderr(tmp_path):
    """Verify no emoji bytes appear when no critical regressions found."""
    # Write minimal fixtures
    _write_results(current, 1.0)  # No regression
    _write_results(baseline, 1.0)
    
    # Run actual script
    result = _run(current, baseline)
    
    # Guard against emoji byte prefixes
    for prefix in (b"\xf0\x9f", b"\xe2\x9d\x8c", b"\xe2\x9c\x85"):
        assert prefix not in result.stderr
    
    # Verify correct text appears
    assert b"PASS" in result.stderr
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests real script behavior, not mock behavior
- Catches subtle issues (emoji encoding, output format)
- Fixtures are minimal and clear
- No need to mock subprocess/file I/O
- Runs end-to-end in CI

**Lesson**: For CLI/script testing, prefer subprocess-based integration tests over unit mocks. More fragile to false negatives, but catches real issues.

### 4. CLAUDE.md Emoji Rule Scope: User-Facing Output Only

**Scope Question**: Does the "no emoji unless explicitly requested" rule apply to Markdown report emojis?

**Answer**: No. The rule applies to **user-facing output (stderr)**, not intentional visual indicators in **rendered Markdown reports**.

**Evidence from Plan Review**:
- Emoji in `scripts/compare_benchmarks.py` stderr (lines 131, 134) → **violates rule** (command-line output)
- Emoji in `hephaestus/benchmarks/compare.py` Markdown report tables → **out of scope** (visual severity indicators in report)

**Key Distinction**:
- stderr/stdout/console output: Plain ASCII only (portability across CI systems)
- Markdown/report output: Emoji allowed (intentional visual design for humans reading reports)

**Lesson**: Scope rules are context-dependent. Clarify in planning phase which output surfaces the rule applies to.

## Implementation Details

### Files Changed
1. **scripts/compare_benchmarks.py** lines 131, 134:
   - Changed `❌ FAILED:` → `FAIL:`
   - Changed `✅ No critical regressions detected` → `PASS: No critical regressions detected`

2. **tests/unit/scripts/test_compare_benchmarks_no_emoji.py** (new):
   - Test passes on both PASS and FAIL paths
   - Guards against emoji byte prefixes (\xf0\x9f, \xe2\x9d\x8c, \xe2\x9c\x85)
   - Runs actual script with minimal fixtures

### Verification Status
- ✅ Local tests pass (all 2 emoji guard tests + 16 benchmark tests)
- ✅ Ruff linting and formatting pass
- ✅ Commit signature verified via REST API (`verified: true, reason: "valid"`)
- ✅ PR #962 created with `state:implementation-go` label
- ⏳ CI pr-policy check pending (should pass with correct email)

## What Would Go Into ProjectMnemosyne Skill

**Skill Name**: `gpg-signing-email-pr-policy-validation`  
**Category**: `ci-cd`  
**Verification**: `verified-local` (signature verified, pr-policy pending in CI)

This captures the pr-policy signing failure and the correct workflow for fixing it.
