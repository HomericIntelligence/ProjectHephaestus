"""Declarative stage-routing table. Pure data, zero I/O (epic #1809).

``ROUTES`` is the executable authority for stage order, success and failure
targets, and per-item budgets. Documentation describes its schema, while
tests generate structural and scoped-routing cases from the table.

All budgets are per-item-lifetime counters (tracked in ``WorkItem.attempts``);
they are never reset when an item re-enters a stage, so cross-stage
regression cycles remain globally bounded.
