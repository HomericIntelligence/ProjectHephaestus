# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records significant architectural decisions for ProjectHephaestus
using the [Nygard ADR format](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).
Each ADR is immutable once Accepted; supersede rather than edit.

To add an ADR: take the next zero-padded number, copy the section skeleton from
any existing ADR (`# ADR-NNNN: …`, `- Status:`, `- Date:`, `- Tracks:`,
`## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Alternatives considered`, `## Consequences`),
and add a row to the table below. The structural guard
`tests/unit/docs/test_adr_records.py` keeps every ADR well-formed, contiguously
numbered, and listed here.
