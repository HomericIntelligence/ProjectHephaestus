"""Follow-up prompt: identify in-scope follow-ups discovered during implementation."""

from ._shared import _TERSE_OUTPUT_DIRECTIVE

FOLLOW_UP_PROMPT = """
Review your work on issue #{issue_number} and identify follow-up items
**discovered during implementation** that fall within strict scope.

{terse_output_directive}

## Scope (HARD GUARDRAIL)

A follow-up is allowed ONLY when it is one of:

1. **core** — A defect, gap, or required change in the **core library functionality**
   that this repository directly owns. Adding tests for the code you just wrote
   counts as core. Adding tests for unrelated modules does NOT.
2. **security** — A concrete security finding (input validation, secret handling,
   permission boundary, etc.). Generic "we should review security some day" does NOT.
3. **safety** — A reliability / safety hazard with a concrete repro path
   (data loss, deadlock, leaked resources, race condition, missing cleanup).
4. **critical_bug** — A functional bug with user-visible impact and a concrete repro.
   Cosmetic, theoretical, or nitpick bugs do NOT qualify here — and minor bugs
   should be filed manually, not via this automation.

Anything else is OUT OF SCOPE and MUST be rejected. In particular, the
following are explicitly NOT follow-ups:

- New features, enhancements, or "nice to have" expansions
- Documentation polish, README rewrites, contributor-guide additions
- Refactors driven by aesthetic preferences rather than concrete defects
- Test coverage for code outside what you just touched
- Tooling/CI/dependency suggestions unrelated to the implementation
- Cross-repo migrations, ecosystem-wide changes
- Speculative research, "consider switching to X", "evaluate Y"
- Anything that would expand the issue's domain into new areas
- Anything you could just do in this PR but chose not to

If in doubt, REJECT. Filing fewer follow-ups is the goal.

## Output format (single JSON object)

Return EXACTLY one JSON object with two arrays. Both arrays may be empty.

```json
{{
  "follow_ups": [
    {{
      "category": "core" | "security" | "safety" | "critical_bug",
      "title": "Short specific title (<70 chars)",
      "body": "Concrete description with file:line evidence and a sketch fix"
    }}
  ],
  "rejected": [
    {{
      "title": "Item you considered but rejected",
      "reason": "One sentence: which scope rule it failed and why"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Each `follow_ups` item MUST include `category`. The four allowed values are
`core`, `security`, `safety`, `critical_bug`. Any other category is rejected
by the parser.

The `rejected` list is for items you considered but excluded under the scope
rules. List them so the operator can see what was suppressed — they will be
recorded in the PR body, not filed as issues. Keep it short; only include
items where the rejection itself is informative.

## Caps and quality bar

- HARD CAP: at most **3** follow-ups in `follow_ups`. Pick the most important.
  More than 3 means you are over-scoping.
- Each `body` MUST cite `file:line` evidence or a concrete repro path.
- Do NOT pad. If there are no qualifying items, return
  `{{"follow_ups": [], "rejected": []}}`.

## Examples

**Good** (qualifies as `safety`):
```json
{{
  "category": "safety",
  "title": "Worktree leaks on SIGINT at implementer.py:402",
  "body": "Worktree created before the dry-run guard; SIGINT leaks build/.worktrees/issue-N."
}}
```

**Bad** (rejected as out-of-scope feature expansion):
```json
{{"title": "Add a web dashboard for automation status",
  "reason": "Feature expansion into a new domain (web UI); not a defect in core functionality."}}
```

**Bad** (rejected as documentation polish):
```json
{{"title": "Improve README intro section",
  "reason": "Documentation polish; not a defect, security, safety, or bug."}}
```
