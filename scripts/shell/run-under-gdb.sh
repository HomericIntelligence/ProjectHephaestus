# run-under-gdb.sh — run any command under gdb to catch crash signals that
# the program's own in-process signal handler would otherwise swallow.
#
# Some runtimes (JIT compilers, sanitizer runtimes, language VMs) install
# their own SIGABRT/SIGSEGV/SIGILL handlers that catch a fatal signal, print
# a terse post-handler trace, and exit cleanly — so the kernel never produces
# a core and the *real* faulting frame is lost. Running the command under gdb
# stops the inferior in the debugger BEFORE its own handler runs, so a real
# ELF core and a full backtrace can be captured at the moment of fault.
#
# Usage:
#   run-under-gdb.sh <core-dir> <command> [args...]
#
#   <core-dir>   Directory for cores and gdb logs (created if absent).
#   <command>    The program to run. Resolved via PATH if not an absolute
#                path. All remaining arguments are passed to it verbatim.
#
# Environment variables:
#   RUN_UNDER_GDB=0       Skip gdb entirely and exec the command directly
#                         (local-dev escape hatch — gdb adds overhead).
#   GDB_CMD_PREFIX        Optional command prefix inserted before `gdb`, e.g.
#                         "pixi run --" or "conda run -n env --", so gdb and
#                         its inferior inherit an activated environment.
#                         Default: empty (gdb is run directly).
#
# Output files (written on crash):
#   <core-dir>/core.gdb.<timestamp>  — ELF core (multi-MB)
#   <core-dir>/gdb-<timestamp>.log   — backtrace + threads + shared libraries
#
# Exit code:
#   - 0 / N            normal exit with the inferior's own exit code N
#   - 128 + signo      the inferior was stopped by a caught signal
#                      (134 = SIGABRT, 139 = SIGSEGV, 132 = SIGILL, ...)

# The gdb script uses Python event hooks rather than a plain gdb-script `if`

#     including normal exit, where `generate-core-file` then fails with
#     "You can't do that without a process to debug".
#  2. `--return-child-result` is unreliable in batch mode for processes
#     killed by *handled* signals: gdb often exits 0 even when the inferior
#     died on a signal, masking the failure entirely.
# Python events cleanly distinguish gdb.SignalEvent (real crash) from
# gdb.ExitedEvent (clean exit) and record the intended exit code to a file
# that this wrapper reads back afterwards.
